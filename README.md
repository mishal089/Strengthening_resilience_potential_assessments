This repository contains the data from a systematic literature review of coral reef resilience potential assessments detailed in Gudka et al.'s paper 'Strengthening resilience potential assessments for coral reef management'.  
It also contains R code scripts to explore, analyse and visualise the data. 

The data and code is licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (see License file for full details). This license permits most uses of the content, subject to providing credit and license notice. Please contact the author Mishal Gudka on mishal.gudka08@gmail.com should you use the content or have any questions.

The files are split into 2 folders - Rapid evaluation (file=script_explore_rapid_eval_data_final_assessments.Rmd; data = review_rapid_eval_data) which was used to evaluate assessments against a select few criteria that were used to identify resilience potential assessments based on our definition.
Detailed evaluation (file = script_explore_detail_eval_data.Rmd.; data = review_detailed_eval_data.csv) assesses the selected assessments against the remaining criteria.  

The files provided should enable users to reproduce all figures (including supplementary results) and analysis except the map of Meow eco-regions of the world (Figure 2).
