This repository contains the data from a systematic literature review of resilience potential assessments detailed in Gudka et al.'s paper 'Strengthening resilience potential assessments for coral reef management'.  
It also contains scripts to explore, analyse and visualise the data. 

The files are split into 2 folders - Rapid evaluation (file=script_explore_rapid_eval_data_final_assessments.Rmd; data = review_rapid_eval_data) which was used to evaluate assessments against a select few criteria that were used to identify resilience potential assessments based on our definition.
Detailed evaluation (file = script_explore_detail_eval_data.Rmd.; data = review_detailed_eval_data.csv) assesses the selected assessments against the remaining criteria.  

The files provided should enable users to reproduce all figures (including supplementary results) and analysis except the map of Meow eco-regions of the world (Figure 2).
