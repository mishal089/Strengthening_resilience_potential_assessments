May not be an index of indices as initially thought. What they refer to as Benthic Index is a ratio of coral cover: algae cover (I think), then 4 indicators are based on 1 variable, and Grouper indicator is an index, but not sure of what. 

Actually do a good job of normalising each indicator against what seems to be well thought out health thresholds",Definitely not
